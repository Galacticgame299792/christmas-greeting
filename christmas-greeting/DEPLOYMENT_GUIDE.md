# 🎄 Complete Guide: Adding Music & Uploading to GitHub

## Part 1: Adding Background Music 🎵

### Step 1: Get a Christmas Song

**Option A: Free Music Sources (Recommended)**
1. **YouTube Audio Library** (No account needed)
   - Go to: https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC/music
   - Search for "Christmas" or "Holiday"
   - Download MP3 format

2. **Pixabay Music** (Free, no attribution required)
   - Go to: https://pixabay.com/music/search/christmas/
   - Browse and download your favorite
   - Click "Free Download" → Choose MP3

3. **Free Music Archive**
   - Go to: https://freemusicarchive.org/
   - Search "Christmas instrumental"
   - Download MP3

**Option B: Use Your Own Music**
- Any MP3 file you already have
- Make sure it's in MP3 format

### Step 2: Add Music to Your Project

1. **Download the music file** to your computer
2. **Rename it to `music.mp3`** (exactly this name)
3. **Move it to your project folder:**
   ```
   c:/Users/premj/OneDrive/ドキュメント/Game Development/Work/christmas-greeting/
   ```
4. **Place it in the same folder as `index.html`**

Your folder should now look like:
```
christmas-greeting/
├── index.html
├── gift.png
├── snowman.png
├── heart.png
├── santa.png
├── bg-cloud.jpg
└── music.mp3  ← Your music file here!
```

That's it! The music will automatically play when someone taps the gift box.
